        <p>Research Log - SCP-087 Exploration (Second Test)</p>
        <p>Date: 08/29/2003</p>
        <p>Research Team: Dr. Emily Anderson, Researcher Mark Stevens, Security Officer Johnson</p>
        <p>Objective: To conduct a second exploration of SCP-087 and gather additional data on the anomaly and its
            associated entity, SCP-087-1.</p>
        <p>[Begin Log]</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Following our previous encounter with SCP-087-1, we are embarking on a second expedition to
            further understand its behavior and characteristics. Our goal is to gather more comprehensive data and
            assess potential containment measures.</p>
        <p>Researcher Stevens: We have made some adjustments based on our previous experience. Our lighting equipment
            has been enhanced, and we have implemented additional communication protocols to ensure efficient
            coordination.</p>
        <p>Security Officer Johnson: Rest assured, we are well-prepared and ready for any challenges that may arise.
            Safety remains our top priority.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Let's proceed cautiously and document any significant observations or encounters. Remember to
            stay alert and follow established protocols.</p>
        <p>[The team begins their descent into SCP-087, fully equipped with improved lighting and communication
            devices.]</p>
        <p>Researcher Stevens: The atmosphere feels even more oppressive than before. The air is thick and the sound of
            footsteps is already audible.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Document any changes in the environment and note the distance covered as accurately as
            possible.</p>
        <p>[As they descend, the team reaches a depth of approximately 150 flights of stairs.]</p>
        <p>Security Officer Johnson: I'm hearing a faint crying sound. It's similar to what we encountered during our
            previous exploration.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Acknowledged. Let's proceed with caution and maintain constant communication.</p>
        <p>[The team continues their descent, the crying sound growing louder and more distressing.]</p>
        <p>Researcher Stevens: The ambient lighting is starting to flicker intermittently. It's becoming increasingly
            difficult to see ahead.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Stay alert and rely on your supplementary lighting equipment. Document any anomalous phenomena
            observed.</p>
        <p>[The team arrives at a landing with a doorway leading to a narrow corridor.]</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: This area matches our previous encounter. Be prepared for the presence of SCP-087-1.</p>
        <p>[As they enter the corridor, SCP-087-1 is observed standing at the end.]</p>
        <p>Security Officer Johnson: SCP-087-1 is stationary, but its presence is unsettling. Maintaining visual
            contact.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Observe its behavior and any changes in its appearance or movement. Document everything.</p>
        <p>[SCP-087-1 begins to move toward the team, prompting them to retreat.]</p>
        <p>Security Officer Johnson: We need to retreat immediately! It's pursuing us!</p>
        <p>[The team rapidly ascends the stairs, closely pursued by SCP-087-1.]</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: Maintain a steady pace and ensure visual contact. Safety is paramount.</p>
        <p>[The team reaches a higher landing and barricades the doorway behind them.]</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson: We have successfully evaded SCP-087-1 once again. Its persistence and aggression are notable
            characteristics.</p>
        <p>Researcher Stevens: Our findings indicate that SCP-087-1's behavior is consistent across multiple encounters.
            Additional analysis is necessary to develop effective containment measures.</p>
        <p>[End Log]</p>

        <p>Note: Further exploration of SCP-087 has been temporarily suspended due to the aggressive behavior exhibited
            by SCP-087-1. Additional research and analysis are required to develop appropriate containment measures and
            ensure the safety of personnel involved.</p>
