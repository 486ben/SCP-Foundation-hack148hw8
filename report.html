        <p>Research Log - SCP-087 Exploration</p>

        <p>Date: 11/19/2001</p>
        <p>Research Team: Dr. Emily Anderson, Researcher Mark Stevens, Security Officer Johnson</p>
        <p>Objective: To explore and document the phenomenon within SCP-087, also known as the "Endless Staircase."</p>

        <p>[Begin Log]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Today marks our first official expedition into SCP-087. Our previous investigations have
            revealed very little, and it's time we shed some light on this mysterious anomaly. Let's proceed with
            caution, team.</p>

        <p>Researcher Stevens: Understood, Dr. Anderson. I've equipped our team with additional lighting and
            communication devices to ensure safety and effective communication during the exploration.</p>

        <p>Security Officer Johnson: Don't worry, Doc. I'll be keeping a close eye on the surroundings. If anything goes
            wrong, I've got your backs.</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Excellent. Let's begin our descent and document any abnormalities we encounter.</p>

        <p>[The team begins their descent into SCP-087. The air feels heavy and the atmosphere grows increasingly
            tense.]</p>

        <p>Researcher Stevens: The staircase seems never-ending, as if it stretches into infinity. It's difficult to
            judge the distance we've covered so far.</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Keep an eye out for any anomalies or changes in the environment. Document everything we
            observe.</p>

        <p>[After descending for approximately 100 flights of stairs, the team encounters the first significant
            anomaly.]</p>

        <p>Security Officer Johnson: Hold on a second. Do you hear that?</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Yes, it sounds like distant footsteps.</p>

        <p>Researcher Stevens: The sound seems to be coming from below us, echoing up the staircase. Let's proceed
            cautiously.</p>

        <p>[The team continues their descent, following the sound of footsteps. The tension in the air becomes
            palpable.]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: The ambient lighting is starting to fade. Stevens, activate the supplementary lighting
            equipment.</p>

        <p>Researcher Stevens: Lights on. Proceeding.</p>

        <p>[The team reaches a landing with a doorway leading to a dark corridor.]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: We've reached a point of interest. Let's investigate further.</p>

        <p>[As the team enters the corridor, the sound of footsteps grows louder.]</p>

        <p>Security Officer Johnson: There it is! Look!</p>

        <p>[The team shines their lights on a shadowy figure, SCP-087-1, standing at the end of the corridor.]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Document everything, but maintain a safe distance. Observe its behavior and any other details.
        </p>

        <p>[SCP-087-1 starts to move towards the team, prompting them to retreat.]</p>

        <p>Security Officer Johnson: It's coming closer! We need to retreat!</p>

        <p>[The team rapidly ascends the stairs, closely pursued by SCP-087-1.]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: Maintain visual contact, but keep moving!</p>

        <p>[The team manages to reach a higher landing and barricades the doorway behind them.]</p>

        <p>Dr. Anderson: We have successfully evaded SCP-087-1. It's clear that this anomaly is aggressive and poses a
            significant threat.</p>

        <p>Security Officer Johnson: Agreed. We should regroup and analyze our findings before attempting further
            exploration.</p>

        <p>[End Log]</p>

        <p>Note: Further exploration of SCP-087 has been temporarily suspended due to the aggressive behavior exhibited
            by SCP-087-1. Additional research and analysis are required to develop appropriate containment measures and
            ensure the safety of personnel involved.</p>
